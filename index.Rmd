## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to...

Last year I took gov 40 and I looked at a topic that really interested me, so I would like to research it further. This topic examines the effects of gender norms on female terrorism. The article that I used for that project was called "Wolves in Sheepâ€™s Clothing: Assessing the Effect of Gender Norms on the Lethality of Female Suicide Terrorism" by Jakana L. Thomas, but for this project I can find another source! 

```{r}
library(tidyverse) 
library(haven)
data <- read_dta("JThomas_IO.dta")

View(data)
data |>
summary(female0_1)


```
